# Walk in My Mind Palace ðŸ§ 

Welcome to my digital mind palace, a place where I document and share my learnings, ideas, and insights with the world.

## Why this Learnlog?

This space is meant to **capture knowledge** in a **structured** yet engaging way. My goal is to make complex topics more accessible and practical.
\
I aim to share my learnings and progress (both technical and personal). I feel sharing one's progress pushes one forward to be better, not to mention how it might impact others.
I hope this helps both me and everyone who comes across my articles.

## What to Expect

- **Tech & Development**: Back-end, front-end, system design, and everything in between.
- **Problem Solving**: My approach to tackling challenges in code and beyond.
- **Personal Growth (blog)**: Lessons from experience, productivity hacks, and mindset shifts.
- **Projects & Experiments**: Things I'm building, breaking, and refining.
