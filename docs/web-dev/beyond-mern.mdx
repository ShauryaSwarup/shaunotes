# Going beyond MERN

I will **NOT** be covering what **[MERN](https://www.mongodb.com/resources/languages/mern-stack)** is. :)
\
But let me tell you this -- **EVERYONE** knows the MERN stack. It might be a good start to development, but it very well isn't the end.

## Front-End

The first question you should ask yourself is, do you really even know how React works? \
You say that you are a MERN stack developer, but knowing the underlying principles (aka **first principles**), is what sets you apart.

Sharpen your front-end knowledge ðŸ‘‡

## Back-End

The back-end is where the magic happens. âœ¨\
You should know how to write efficient code, and how to make your codebase scalable.
\
\
I frankly love back-end Development. It involves a lot of brainstorming and critical thinking that excites me way more than front-end development. That being said, I do respect front-end developers because it is quite a challenge to make a fully functional and attractive website.

But is back-end just Authentication and CRUD operations? ðŸ¤”
\
The answer is **NO**. There is a lot more to back-end development than just that.

Sharpen your back-end knowledge ðŸ‘‡
