# Understanding How React Works ⚛️

If you truly want to master React beyond just using it, you need to understand its **core principles** and **internal mechanisms**. Here’s a structured guide to what you should know:

## 1️⃣ React’s Core Principles

- **[Declarative UI](https://ui.dev/c/react/imperative-vs-declarative)** – Why React prefers declarative over imperative programming.
- **[Component-Based Architecture](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component)** – How React structures applications into reusable components.
- **[Unidirectional Data Flow](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component)** – Understanding the single source of truth and props-driven UI updates.
- **[Virtual DOM & Reconciliation](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/createRoot#rendering-and-reconciliation)** – How React efficiently updates the UI.

## 2️⃣ React’s Rendering & Reconciliation

- **[Diffing Algorithm & Fiber Architecture](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/createRoot#rendering-and-reconciliation)** – How React reconciles updates efficiently.
- **[Commit & Render Phases](https://blog.saeloun.com/2022/05/18/react-fiber-architecture.html)** – The lifecycle of an update.
- **[Batching & Prioritization](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#state-updates-are-batched)** – How React batches state updates to optimize performance.

## 3️⃣ React State Management

- **[useState & useReducer](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState)** – When to use each and how they work under the hood.
- **[Context API vs. Redux vs. Recoil](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)** – Understanding state-sharing mechanisms.
- **[React’s Event System](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/common#event-handlers)** – How React handles synthetic events and event delegation.

## 4️⃣ React Hooks & React Internals

- **[Rules of Hooks & Closure Traps](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#rules-of-hooks)** – Why hooks work the way they do.
- **[useEffect & Cleanup Mechanisms](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect)** – Understanding side effects and dependency arrays.
- **[Custom Hooks](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks)** – How to build reusability within React.

## 5️⃣ Concurrent React & React 18 Advancements

- **[Concurrent Mode & Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense)** – How React prioritizes rendering for a better UX.
- **[React Server Components](https://react.dev/blog/2024/01/24/react-canary#react-server-components)** – How React renders components on the server.

## 6️⃣ Performance Optimization in React

- **[React.memo & useCallback/useMemo](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo)** – Preventing unnecessary renders.
- **[Code Splitting & Lazy Loading](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy)** – Optimizing bundle size.
- **[React Profiler & Debugging Performance Issues](https://react.dev/blog/2018/09/10/introducing-the-react-profiler)** – Tools to analyze rendering behavior.

## 7️⃣ Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & Hydration

- **[Next.js & React SSR](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#server-side-rendering-ssr)** – Why SSR improves performance and SEO.
- **[Hydration & Partial Hydration](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/react-18#streaming-and-partial-hydration)** – How React reuses server-rendered content.

## 8️⃣ React & Browser Fundamentals

- **[JavaScript Closures & Scope in React](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)** – Why re-renders behave unexpectedly.
- **[Event Loop & Microtasks in React](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Event_loop)** – Understanding async behaviors.
- **[Web APIs vs. React State](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API)** – Why not everything belongs in state.

By diving into these topics, you'll go beyond just **writing React apps**—you'll **understand how React works** from the inside out! 🚀
